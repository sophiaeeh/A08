                <p>What’s 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage Utahceratops! Come to the Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur roar, when Scott Sampson, Research Curator at the Utah Museum of Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson’s research has focused on the ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has conducted fieldwork in a number of countries in Africa.</p>
                <p>Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on two new species of ceratopsids from the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the growth and function of ceratopsid horns and frills.</p>
                <p>Following graduation, Sampson worked at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and later at the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine. He arrived at the University of Utah, accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the Department of Geology and Geophysics and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Utah Museum of Natural History.</p>
                <p>In addition to his research, Sampson has conducted paleontological work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, Madagascar, the United States, and Canada. He was the on-air host for the Discovery Channel’s <em>Dinosaur Planet</em> and wrote <em>Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of Life</em>, one of the most comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and their worlds to date.</p>
